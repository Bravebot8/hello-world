Kraków is home to a famous legend about the Wawel Dragon (Smok Wawelski). According to the legend, a fearsome dragon once lived in a cave at the foot of Wawel Hill, terrorizing the city and demanding regular offerings of cattle (and according to some versions, young maidens). Many knights tried to defeat the dragon but failed.

The story goes that a clever cobbler named Skuba came up with a plan. He stuffed a sheep with sulfur and left it for the dragon to eat. After consuming the sheep, the dragon became incredibly thirsty and drank so much water from the Vistula River that it exploded.

Today, the Dragon’s Den (Smocza Jama) is a popular tourist attraction, and a statue of the Wawel Dragon stands at the entrance of the cave. This statue breathes fire at regular intervals, delighting visitors and keeping the legend alive.

Kraków's connection to the Wawel Dragon is a beloved part of its cultural heritage and adds a mythical charm to the city's rich history.
